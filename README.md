A retro-futurist landing page showcasing a subtly animated colour gradient

Deployed with Surge

The placeholder heading is the title of a short story by Philip K. Dick as I thought it would fit the style of the page

The page features the font 'format 1452' by Frank Adebiaye with contributions by Anton Moglia via the [Velvetyne Font Foundry](https://velvetyne.fr)
